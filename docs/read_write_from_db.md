# Database

We'll store books in our database and display them on our page. To do so, we need a way to read and write to our database. There are two types of objects that we'll use for this:

* entity
  * is a domain object(a book) that is uniquely identified by its identity,
  * repository is what we use to persist, retrieve, and delete data for an entity, in the persistence layter
